# HACKNYFALL
The game involves a segment called “Split or Steal” in which two participants make the decision to “split” or “steal” to determine how the final jackpot is divided.

    If both contestants choose to split, the jackpot is split equally between them.
    If one contestant chooses to split and the other chooses to steal, the Stealer gets all the money and the Splitter gets nothing.
    If both contestants choose to steal, they both get nothing.
